# Custom Forms Generator for Flutter

## About The Project

Developed during the HackUdC Hackathon, this innovative Flutter application dynamically generates customized forms based on specifications provided by an external API. Aimed at streamlining the development process, our solution offers an efficient way to create highly adaptable and user-friendly forms for Flutter apps. By fetching form configurations from an API, developers can easily integrate a variety of input fields, validations, and custom styles without manual coding, significantly reducing development time and effort.

### Built With

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
- Your choice of backend technology (mention here if any specific like Node.js, Flask, etc.)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Flutter installed on your development machine. To check your Flutter installation, run the following command:

```sh
flutter doctor
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```

2. Install Flutter packages:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the application:

```sh
flutter run
```

## Usage

The application works by fetching form configurations from a specified API. Here is a basic guide on how to use it:

1. **API Configuration**: Ensure your API is set up to deliver form configurations in JSON format. The structure should define the form fields, types, validations, and any other necessary parameters.

2. **Fetching Data**: Upon application launch, it fetches the form configuration from the API.

3. **Rendering Forms**: Based on the fetched data, the application dynamically generates the form within the Flutter app, complete with specified input types, validations, and customizations.

For more detailed information on how to configure your API and customize form elements, please refer to the documentation section.
